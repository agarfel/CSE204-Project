### Playlist-based song recommender ###

input a playlist, output a playlist of other songs based on similarities with the ones inputed.

our algorithm relies on using features associated to each songs to compute distances between all of them.<br>
Once all the distances are computed we can call the function with a playlist of N songs specifying that we expect<br>
a playlist of K recommended songs. From there we take all the distances from one song of the input to all of <br>
the dataset without the inputed songs. We get a matrix with as rows all the songs in the dataset without our input,<br>
and as columns all the songs in the input, with as elements of the matrix itself the distances between the row<br>
songs and the column songs. To get the recommended playlist we take the K smallest sums over each row.<br>

we have two ways of computing distances : <br>
1. The first algorithm relies on 6 'features' associated with each songs :
- hottness (a number from 0-1)
- tempo (a number from 0-1)
- loudness (a number from 0-1)
- similar artists (list of similar artist based on the song)
- artist terms (list of genre associated to the song)
- artist terms weights (list of weights from 0-1 associated to each term mentionned above)
we then define a distance function ourselves

2. The second algorithm relies on the use of autoencoder network and 5 features :
- hottness (a number from 0-1)
- tempo (a number from 0-1)
- loudness (a number from 0-1)
- artist terms (list of genre associated to the song)
- artist terms weights (list of weights from 0-1 associated to each term mentionned above)
the distance between two songs was defined by taking the euclidean distance between the encoding of these songs

all the songs used for this algorithm come from the million song dataset which one can find at the <br>
